## Getting Started

To install this example application, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example.git
cd okta-react-css-grid-example
npm install
```

### Create an OIDC App on Okta

Register a new application by going to **Applications** > **Add Application**. On the next screen, choose **Single Page App** and click **Next**.

On the following screen, you can edit the application's settings. Make sure that the port number is 3000 and the base URI is `http://localhost:3000/`. Change the Login Redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000/callback`. Once you are done, you will see a **Client ID**.

### Configure your Okta Settings

Copy your Okta domain and client ID into `src/App.js`:

```js
<Router>
  <Security issuer='https://{YourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default'
            clientId='{ClientId}'
            redirectUri={window.location.origin + '/callback'}
            pkce={true}>
    <SecureRoute path='/' exact={true} component={Unicode}/>
    <Route path='/callback' component={LoginCallback}/>
  </Security>
</Router>
```

Start everything with `npm start` and you'll be able to login with React and Okta!
